 Banking_Management_System

 I have created a java project on banking system using databases connectivity. In which user can register or login by using email id or password. The system will generate a unique account number for every new user while making a transaction or any operation the system will ask for a security pin to perform a specific operation like checking balance, Depositing money, Money Withdrawl and Fund Transfer to a existing bank account in my database.

Objective:
1. Enhanced User Security
2. Easily Understandable
3. Flexible

This project is not a team project i done this project on myself only.
